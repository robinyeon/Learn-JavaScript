## Advanced if
- Using an **if** condition, you can run a piece of code when the condition evaluates to ```true```.
- The syntax is ```if (condition)``` and then curly braces ```{}``` wrap the lines of code that correspond to this condition.
- The **else** keyword can be used to perform some other code based on all the other conditions not satisfied with the ```if```.
- When you have an ```if/else``` condition that returns two different results, it is possible to drop the ```else``` keyword.
- Always use triple equals (===) when comparing 2 values in JavaScript.
