- A substring is a part or a portion of a string.
- ```string.substring(indexStart, indexEnd)``` is used to return a portion of the string.
- **indexStart**: the position of the first character you'd like to **include**.
- **indexEnd**: the position of the first character you'd like to **ignore**.
- the **indexEnd** argument is optional which means you can leave it out.
