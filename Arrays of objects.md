## Arrays of objects
- Arrays of objects are the most common data type that you will encounter when working in web development, that's because most APIs (for example, a weather API, Twitter API, etc.) return arrays of objects.
- **Always visualize the inner object(s)**
  - A very important tip when working with arrays of objects, especially when iterating over an array of objects, is to add `console.log()` throughout your code to visualize the object that you receive in the callback.
